Name the United States

SUMMARY:
This started as a simple one page game to help me memorize all 50 USA states.

Grew a bit as I explored various SVG interactions and other points of interest,
and other random things I thought up.

DESCRIPTION:
I initially created this because I wanted to memorize all 50 states and I'd
always get stuck on the last handful for some reason.  First version just had
the names listed and blurred and unblurred as guesses were entered.

Because the states were initially shown blurred out and in alphabetical
order, it actually provided a hint for unguessed states.  I think this kept the
actual 'memorization' less effective. Early on, it was challenging, but as my
memorization of the states got better, it became too much of a hint, so I ended
up adding a "shuffle_states" param to increase the difficulty.

Later I added the SVG map and various other 'features' that turned it into a
bit more of a 'game', and ultimately added Quiz Mode.

Even though one just has to simply view the source to learn of some intentional
ways to cheat, most of these I added to aid early on development.

If you leverage one of the cheats or some other mechanism to avoid actually
memorizing the states, remember kids, you are only cheating yourself :o)

It started out simple but feature creep set in as I had fun adding the various
enhancements, effects and learning other things along the way.


Details about URL params and buttons...

["shuffle_states" search term in URL]
Adding "shuffle_states" to the URL and loading the page will
shuffle the state object array. Shuffling the array causes the grid of state
names to be ordered randomly. This increases the difficulty a bit if you've been
relying on the alphabetical listing to give hints for missing states as you
play.

["debug" search term in URL]
Adding "debug" to the URL will cause debug.js to be included
and various debug elements and debug/test functionality will be added. This was
most useful during initial design/implementation.

["hide_map" search term in URL]
Adding "hide_map" to the URI, the page will be loaded with
the map hidden.  This + shuffling the states is the highest difficulty.

["quiz_mode=<quiz_type>" search term in URL]
Adding "quiz_mode" to the URL, starts the game in Quiz Mode, where the target
state is shown popped out of the map and with a "marching ants" type of
highlight.  You must guess that states name.  The quiz takes you through all 50
states. If <quiz_type>="random", the order of the states are picked at random.
If <quiz_type>="alphabetical" (or no type provided), the states are picked in
alphabetical order.

Example URL with all params:
    NameTheUnitedStates.html?shuffle_states&hide_map&debug

...and yes, you _could_ have "shuffle_states&hide_map&quiz_mode".  This is a
secret hidden "insane" difficulty level.  Give it a try! :o)


Debug Mode:
Some buttons are a textarea are added below the map.
["Show All" button] In "Debug" mode, clicking this button will show all state
names, color the states, and show the abbreviations.

["Solve Map" Button]
Jumps to the solved state, showing entire map with abbreviations and list of
states unblurred (and the animation).

["Reset Map" button]
Gets the map back into initial state; unsolved, abbreviations hidden.

["Test Button"] In "Debug" mode, clicking this button runs whatever
test/experiment code executed by the doTest() function. This changed over time
as the page was being developed.  Click it and see what happens! :o)

Also, in debug mode:
Clicking on a state shows the state name and the abbreviation in the output
textarea. Ex.  "Washington (WA)", "Oregon (OR)", etc. and also include which
element the click event fired from.
Ctrl+Clicking a state, will show it in the "popout" mode.

NOTE:  Credit for the initial source of the map is given in a comment block
above the SVG element near the bottom of this source, and has been modified
for usage in this 'game', it has a license separate from the one I use for
this game.
